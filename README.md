# pyndi

The aim of this project is to help new learners to learn coding in their mother tongue. It is essentially a wrapper over python which lets users code in 'hindi' and in future other regional languages.

The user can write a code in "pyndi" like the given test_script.pnd. This is then "compiled" by pyndi.py and converted to python code.

The error messages are also in Hindi to make it more understandable for the user.
