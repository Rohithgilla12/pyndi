# pyndi

The aim of this project is to help new learners to learn coding in their mother tongue. It is essentially a wrapper over python which lets users code in 'hindi' and in future other regional languages.

The user can write a code in "pyndi" like the given test_script.pnd. This is then "compiled" by pyndi.py and converted to python code.

The error messages are also in Hindi to make it more understandable for the user.

Still under development phase.

For any re-assignment operations, 

(i) the variable to be re-assigned should be the first string in a line;
(ii) the third string should be either a variable or a number (added, subtracted, multiplied, divided) to be used for re-assignment operations.
